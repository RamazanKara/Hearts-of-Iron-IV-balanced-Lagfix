# Balanced Lagfix Mod for Hearts of Iron IV

## Description

They are lots of lagfixes mods out for hoi4, the issue is that all of these mods either remove minors or force majors into building
high width divisions, which messes up the gamebalance. 
This mod actually prevents lagging by making it impossible for the banned super minors like peru to produce anything, but they still stay in the game. This is a lot less harsh on game balance.
Also there is a lot of background stuff going on that actually improves the performance, without having an effect on balance.
This mod was tested multiple times on our discord server and is also gonna be published in steam. We never had a desync, nor 
did we had a game slow down till 1941, which was a first.It is heavily influenced by the mod "lags never again", but with more emphasis on balance.

If you have suggestions or feedback how to even further improve the late game lag, please feel free to contribute or join the discord:

## Modification

If you want to play a super minor or allow it back into the game, just simply copy back the file from the main game or delete the file in countries from the save game. you can also look up the files and change the production back to the usual number again.
