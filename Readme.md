# Balanced Lagfix Mod for Hearts of Iron IV

## Description

Many mods remove minors or force majors into building
high width divisions, which messes up the gamebalance. 

This mod actually prevents lagging by making it impossible for the super minors like peru to produce anything, but they still stay in the game. This is a lot less harsh on game balance.


Also there is a lot of background stuff going on that actually improves the performance, without having an effect on balance.

This mod was tested multiple times on our discord server and is also gonna be published in steam. We never had a desync, nor 
did we had a game slow down till 1941, which was a first.

If you have suggestions or feedback how to even further improve the late game lag, please feel free to contribute or join the discord:

It is released on the Steam Workshop.

For singleplayer and multiplayer use.
